			<dt><a href="#Section1">Q: What is MapleFM? What is it you guys do?</a></dt>
			<dd id="Section1">
				<p>
					MapleFM is a service which mocks MapleStory's Owl of Minerva. It offers routinely updated FM searches so you don't have to browse fm looking for an item that might not exist!
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><a href="#Section2">Q: Can we change the default world list to our desired list?</a></dt>
			<dd id="Section2">
				<p>
					Yes. This is under your account settings and will work ONLY for a paid subscription.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><a href="#Section3">Q: What is the difference between a paid and non-paid subscription?</a></dt>
			<dd id="Section3">
				<p>
					A paid subscription would have an update time of approximately 20 minutes and would include no Adfly ADs. The free lists automatically updates every 6-7 hours when a paid premium member visits the site. It also requires an adfly ad before displaying the results.

			</dd>
			<dt><a href="#Section4">Q: I ordered a subscription, how long do i have to wait for my subscription?</a></dt>
			<dd id="Section4">
				<p>
					Because the payment process is not automated, for every 24 hours the subscription is not given, you will be compensated 3 additional days. The subscription should be given within 12 hours of purchase. All subscription come with 1 additional day for every 30 days you purchase.
