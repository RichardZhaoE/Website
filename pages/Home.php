		To start off the new year, we are introducing a new powerful interface to ease the browsing of the website.
		<br><br>To be able to take full advantage of the new update, please go to your account profile and update your default world. Failure to do so (and guest accounts) will have the worlds defaulted to Scania.
		<br><br>Create an account and purchase a subscription to *snipe* a certain set of parameters through your account panel! This will allow you to constantly check on the same item OR allow you to see what's sold or unsold in your store when you're not available!
		<br><br>If you are having trouble logging in or registering, make sure javascript is enabled. This site now relies on javascript for most of the functions.
